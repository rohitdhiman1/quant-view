# Multi-Year X-Axis Label Improvements

## Problem
When multiple years were selected (e.g., 2024 and 2025), the x-axis showed only month names like "Jan", "Apr", "Aug", "Nov", "Mar", "Jul" without year information. This made it impossible to determine which months belonged to which year, creating confusion in the visualization.

## Solution
Implemented intelligent x-axis labeling that adapts based on the selection mode:

### Multi-Year Mode (New Behavior)
When 2+ years are selected:

1. **Month + Year Display**
   - January & February: Show full year (e.g., "Jan 2024", "Feb 2025")
   - Quarterly markers: Show month + 2-digit year (e.g., "Mar '24", "Jun '25")
   - Other months: Show month + 2-digit year (e.g., "Apr '24", "Oct '25")

2. **Visual Formatting**
   - Labels angled at -45° for better readability
   - Increased bottom margin (height: 70px) to accommodate angled text
   - Larger tick gap (minTickGap: 40px) to prevent label overlap
   - Intelligent spacing: ~12 labels distributed across the entire date range

3. **Smart Tick Calculation**
   - Automatically adjusts interval based on total data points
   - Formula: `Math.floor(combinedData.length / 12)` for ~12 labels
   - Ensures even distribution across multiple years

### Single-Year Mode (Unchanged)
When 1 year is selected:
- Labels remain horizontal (angle: 0°)
- Shows only month names for cleaner look
- Month-level filtering enabled
- Existing logic preserved for all month selection scenarios

## Technical Implementation

### Key Changes
```typescript
// Added to tickFormatter
if (isMultiYearSelection) {
  const month = date.getMonth()
  
  if (month === 0 || month === 1) {
    // Full year for clarity
    return date.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { 
      month: 'short',
      year: 'numeric'
    })
  } else {
    // 2-digit year for space efficiency
    return date.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { 
      month: 'short',
      year: '2-digit'
    })
  }
}
```

### X-Axis Properties (Multi-Year)
- `angle={-45}` - Angled text for readability
- `textAnchor="end"` - Proper text alignment for angled labels
- `height={70}` - Extra space for angled text
- `minTickGap={40}` - Prevent label collision

## Examples

### Before (Confusing)
```
Jan  Apr  Aug  Nov  Mar  Jul
└─ Which year? 2024? 2025? Unclear! ─┘
```

### After (Clear)
```
Jan 2024  Mar '24  Jul '24  Nov '24  Jan 2025  Mar '25  Jul '25
└────────── 2024 data ──────────┘  └───── 2025 data ─────┘
```

## User Benefits

1. **Clear Year Context**: Always know which year you're looking at
2. **Easy Comparison**: Quickly compare same months across different years
3. **No Ambiguity**: Full year shown at year boundaries (Jan/Feb)
4. **Space Efficient**: 2-digit years save horizontal space
5. **Better Readability**: Angled labels prevent overlap and crowding

## Edge Cases Handled

✅ **2 consecutive years** (e.g., 2024, 2025): Shows full timeline with clear year transitions
✅ **3+ years** (e.g., 2023, 2024, 2025): Intelligent spacing adjusts to data volume
✅ **Non-consecutive years** (e.g., 2020, 2025): Each year clearly labeled
✅ **Large datasets**: Automatic interval calculation prevents label crowding
✅ **Switching modes**: Seamless transition between single/multi-year display

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Potential Improvements
1. **Hover tooltip**: Show exact date on hover for precision
2. **Custom year separator**: Visual divider between years
3. **Year-based color coding**: Different shade for each year's data points
4. **Configurable label format**: User preference for date format
5. **Dynamic font size**: Adjust based on available space

### Performance Considerations
- Current implementation is efficient for up to 8 years of data
- For 10+ years, consider:
  - Reducing label frequency
  - Implementing label rotation thresholds
  - Virtual scrolling for very large datasets

## Testing Checklist

✅ Single year selection → Month labels, no year
✅ Two years selection → Month + Year labels, angled
✅ Three years selection → Month + Year labels, angled
✅ Non-consecutive years → Clear year context maintained
✅ Switch from single to multi → Labels update correctly
✅ Switch from multi to single → Labels revert to month-only
✅ Build succeeds with no errors
✅ No label overlap at various screen sizes
✅ Full/2-digit year display logic working

## Conclusion

This improvement significantly enhances the multi-year visualization experience by providing clear temporal context. Users can now confidently analyze trends across multiple years without confusion about which data belongs to which year.
